Your life is a song.  sometimes is gets stuck and skips but don't forget that you have music to create.  And maybe its a symphony that occurs in different segments. either way all the segments will come together and when they do the end result will be beautiful music for your ears.

you learned the notes and studied the way chords are put together and have made small mellodies stop learning new chords and play you music.
